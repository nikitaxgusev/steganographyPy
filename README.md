It was my first serious project that I wrote on Python (3.6+)  with using windows(tkinter), pil (image) and np.array. The main idea of project is uploading a pic with some file -> encoding, then decode new picture and  the program create a new file , where you should change for the right format. I think , it is easy for using it because there are windows. Note: use only PNG picture , please. Notice about the size of a file ,which you want to upload a picture.
